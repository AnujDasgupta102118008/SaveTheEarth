This is the readme file for a summer induction array of tasks of Spider based on a theme which is a favourite of many but then there are some humans like me who haven't watched a single Marvel movie :( 
I'll descibe Captain America as I have heard a lot about his abilities and power.
Captain America is designed to be a patriotic supersoldier. Steve Rogers wats to get enlisted into the WWII Military but is rejected on medical grounds but he shows extreme self sacrificing attitude which got noticed by Dr. Abrahim who allows him to get enlisted and is selected for the " Super - Soldier " program . Nazi officer Schmidt had stolen an ancient relic called the Tesseract. Captain and his engineer Stark manages to get on Schmidt's plane and Stark manages to get hold of the Tesseract after crash lading in the Arctic. 
Captain was no where to be seen which shows the valour of Captain America. He is one with extreme valour, courage and power.
I have to admit the while researching for this readme , even I have started to like Captain America !
